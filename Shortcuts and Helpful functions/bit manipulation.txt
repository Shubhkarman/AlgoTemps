MULTIPLY X BY 2^k
x<<k;

DIVIDE X BY 2^k
x>>k;


Check if the ith bit is set in the binary form of the given number
if( N & (1 << i) )


1) x ^ ( x & (x-1)) : Returns the rightmost 1 in binary representation of x

2) x & (-x) : Returns the rightmost 1 in binary representation of x

3) x | (1 << n) : Returns the number x with the nth bit set

4) x & ~(1 << n) : Returns the number x with the nth bit UNset
